# Weather App
An app for everyone that simply displays your local weather, built in a maintainable and scalable way.

### Overview
The goal of this app is to create a simple weather app using perfect coding practices. It can easily be scaled, extended, and maintained by another React developer.

### Use Case
Why is this app useful? It allows you to get the weather from your current location, and see what it will be like hours and days from now.

### Live Prototype
The live site can be seen at: [http://intense-shelf-90505.herokuapp.com/](http://intense-shelf-90505.herokuapp.com/)

### Functionality
 - Works as a SPA, allowing the user to view multiple weather components on the same page, without reloading the browser.
 - Has rich charts for displaying the upcoming forecasts.
 - Gives data in Farenheight and Celcius measurements.
 - Implemented with clean design principles.

### Technical
- The app is built mainly with front-end technologies, specifically React, Redux, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Helper libraries such as Lodash, Chart.js, and Minute.js were used as well.
- It utilizes ES6 features of JavaScript, making the code easier to read and maintain. These features are transpiled using Babel to work on all browsers.
- The [Airbnb JavaScript sytle guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is followed to ensure consistent, clean code is produced.
- All front-end components have been tested using Mocha, and the production version passes all tests.
- The front end is fully responsive and follows clean usability principles.
- Continuous integration using Travis CI was used during development.
- Heroku (server hosting) and Cloud9 (editing) were SaaS services used during development and deployment.

### Development Roadmap
This is version 1.0.0 of the app. There are things that can be changed in the future that I'd like to do:
- More weather information and components in general. There are many features that can be added to this.
- More colors and overall visual interest.
